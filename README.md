# BMI CALCULATOR

## The BMI Calculator web application allows users to input their height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms). It calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of body fat based on these inputs. The HTML structure defines input fields for height and weight, while CSS styles enhance the visual elements. JavaScript handles the BMI calculation logic. Users enter their data, click the ‚ÄúCalculate‚Äù button, and the calculated BMI is displayed. This simple yet functional tool helps individuals assess their health based on BMI. Customize and improve this basic example to suit your needs! üåü
